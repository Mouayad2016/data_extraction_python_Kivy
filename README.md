# data_extraction_python_Kivy

# Getting started
Purpose:
The purpose of this assignment is to use a cross platform tool (i.e., Kivy, KivyMD) to create
an application which extracts data using websites and stores them in multiple locations.
This is an application created with python, user interface is created by Kivy, KivyMD, data saves in
firebase and SQLite.
### Background:
Web pages are well known distributed systems where data stored on a remote server is
accessible and visible to the user. Web scraping helps you to extract that remotely stored
data
using a computer program. It is a good source of data collection when there are no API’s or
RSS feeds available. However, web scraping is not always reliable, and it should be updated
periodically. Along with web scraping, you will be handling errors and replicating the data in
multiple locations which is a core feature of a distributed system.
### Tasks:
  1. Designing an application using Kivy, KivyMD
  2. Web scraping data using at least two websites (E.g., “timeanddate.com”,“wunderground.com”)
  3. Handling errors
  4. Storing extracted data using Firebase and another alternate location (Replication)
